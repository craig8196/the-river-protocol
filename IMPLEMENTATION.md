# Implementation

# Language/Runtime
I chose Node.js for the first implementation.
Node has asynchronous behavior from the start.
Mocking up a protocol is hopefully easier using a higher level language.
Node also has reasonable performance for a scripting language.


# Security
Libsodium was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and compactness.
