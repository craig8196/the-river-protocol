# TRP SPECIFICATION

The following is the protocol specification.


## Congestion Control
Even with low levels of data transmission there should be congestion control.
Different quantities of transmission may take different methods of control.

Packet loss transmission interval should be 1 second for regular loads and 500ms for smaller loads.
RTT is round trip time and only one packet should be sent for each RTT on light data loads.
RTT should be determined by ping/keep-alives.
RTT probably should be used to determine a timeout for send data.

For unreliable ordered data, the client should only send the last received per tick.
The server, if it receives multiple messages, it should deliver the latest complete messages and discard any earlier messages.

The client should report the last message index on the stream when requesting to close.
The server should not report currency if it needs client to slow, then client will use exponential backoff until the server is ready.
The ping will determine the connection liveness.

No matter the congestion control, pings should be immediate, but have a large gap between (30 seconds minimum).

On unordered unreliable pipes, the server should still report usage statistics every 10 seconds so packet drop rate can be determined.

Counts of total packets sent/received should be kept and exchanged on ping.
These can help determine the packet loss.
Counters should be reset on each ping? Or some reasonable interval.


## General Notes
* ENCRYPT_PADDING indicates that the following section is encrypted.
* Use exponential backoff up to 5 minutes (or similar) when resending (after 3 tries).
* Always assume breaking encrypted protocol is intended as malicious.
* After reasonable number of attempts, assume non-response as bad behavior.
* Malicious connections are terminated with reject.
* Malicious messages are dropped.
* Failed decryption indicates malicious intent.
* Currency is used to track the max number of outstanding packets for which need reliable sending.
* Streams are created on the fly. The cost of streams is incurred on tear-down.
* Re-typing a stream is an error and is considered malicious.
* Streams are unidirectional; client and server maintain separately indexed streams.


UDP data passed to user program:
* IP Address
* Port
* Message

0 - Stream
1 - Connect
2 - Reject
3 - Accept
4 - Ack
5 - Ping
6 - Disconnect


## Connection Protocol

// TODO Send client version.
**[Client] Open:**
If the address+port are already in use then reject as potentially malicious, let a timeout cleanup the entry.
Otherwise, create a temporary entry for the client.
Floods of open connection requests should be met with increasingly reduced timeouts; if extreme cullings are taking place then errors will be emitted.
| Octets | Field |
|:------ |:----- |
| 1 | Control
| 32 | Public Key Client


// TODO Respond with server version.
// TODO Add a signature to validate that the client has connected to a valid server.
// TODO Add a feature that I just forgot about.
// TODO Add a flag allowing for connection hibernation.
**[Server] Ack:**
If the client does not respond with its nonce, then we have a problem.
The client must assume that the server has as much currency and stream limitations as the client.

## Stream Control Protocol
As a checksum and to save an extra byte, the upper two bits of the Stream
Control value are used to store the stream type, when applicable.

**Challenge/Met:**
When an IP address of a given connection changes a challenge is sent.
If timeout occurs, then connection is dropped.
This is also used as a ping mechanism.
The timestamp must be greater than the previous timestamp from the previous challenge.
The returned response must have the same token and the senders timestamp.
